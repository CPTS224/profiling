* To Profile a C/C++ App *
==========================

1. Compile with -pg flag

    gcc -O0 -g -pg profile.c -o profile -lm

    This will create a gmon.out file, which gprof will use.

2. Run gprof

    gprof ./profile gmon.out > profile.output

3. Examine the Flat Profile

    The flat profile shows the amount of time spent on each function

    Note that for the profile app, we're spending ~55% of our time in the write function, which seems like a lot for such a simple function

4. Examine the callgraph

    Note how much time is being spent in each function, and the relationships between the functions

5. Re-run with cachegrind to get more information

    valgrind --tool=cachegrind ./profile

    Ir - "instruction read" events

    cg_annotate
